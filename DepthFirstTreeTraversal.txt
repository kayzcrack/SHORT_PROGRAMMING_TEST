Depth first is a way of traversing a tree or graph as the case may be.
This approach of traversal simply visits each node before its children.

EXAMPLE :

nodes
----nodeA
		----childA1
		--------childA1node1
		--------childA1node2
		----childA2

----nodeB
		----childB1
		----childB2

----nodeC
		----childC1

programmatically to traverse the above tree

dfs(nodes n){
    visit(n);
    for each children c of n
        if c is unvisited
        {
        dfs(c);
            add edge nc to tree T
        }
 }
 The nodes A, B and C are visited, then for each of these nodes the children are visited, 
 if the children have their own child nodes there are visited as well, this process goes on and
 on until every node is visited in the tree (recursion).
 In depth-first search the idea is to travel as deep as possible from neighbour to neighbour
 once, before backtracking.
